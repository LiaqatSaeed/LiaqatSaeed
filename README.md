### Hi Folks 👋 ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=LiaqatSaeed&color=e91e63)

Full stack software engineer with 6 years of experience building scalable web and mobile applications with (Typescript | React.js | React-Native | Node | Express | MongoDB | ASP.NET MVC | SQL | MYSQL | UI/UX) technologies. I'm looking for a job where I can use my strong organizational skills and ability to work well with people to effective use.

I feel that a man can achieve anything in the field if his technical skills are excellent.  A man with this attitude of doing anything will never face a problem. I believe I am capable of achieving anything, whether it is because of my mindset or my abilities.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on RealStore - Typescript and my Onion architecture on Node Realstore.Api
